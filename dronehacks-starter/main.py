"""Your companion program's entrypoint. The actual flight code is here in refnav/.

Read/edit refnav/core.py for climb, hover, navigation and landing decisions;
refnav/node.py publishes those decisions as native ROS 2/PX4 messages, and
refnav/depth.py processes camera depth. See FLIGHT_CODE.md and tests/.

The lab supplies this complete project; copy its source and dependencies for deployment.
`python3 main.py` directly runs your ROS node, like on a hardware companion.
The optional workbench Run button captures this project for managed
recording and grading. Plain Python does not call the lab API or create a Run.
Read onboard/README.md for perception bringup and native ROS examples.
