"""refnav.core - the reference mission's flight logic. PURE: no ROS, no clock reads, no files.

Everything arrives through calls that carry their own time, on ONE clock chosen by whoever runs
it: simulation time in the simulator and in replays of recorded data (ROS use_sim_time + /clock),
system time on hardware. The same code therefore runs against all three.

The mission: wait until PX4 has a valid position and heading, the estimator reports healthy and
the depth camera is live -> stream a hold setpoint, request Offboard and arm -> climb -> fly a
pre-planned route of legs (each leg: turn to face it, check the depth ahead, advance a carrot at a
bounded speed while the live depth shows the way clear) -> land.

Safety behaviour (each one is a test in tests/test_refnav_core.py):
* fail closed on estimator health: absent, stale or unhealthy refuses to arm; unhealthy or silent
  for health_bad_land_s in the air lands;
* no translation without OBSERVED free space: the carrot advances only while a depth frame no older
  than depth_stale_s returned depth on at least min_corridor_coverage of the rays crossing the
  corridor ahead (no return is unknown space, never free space); a blank, sparse (valid fraction
  < min_valid_frac), future-stamped, stale-on-arrival or out-of-order frame refreshes nothing; no
  usable depth for depth_lost_land_s lands;
* an obstacle closer than stop_m ahead stops the aircraft and ends the route (it lands where it
  is: route blocked; planning around obstacles is the student's job);
* PX4 leaving Offboard while airborne (a pilot or a failsafe) is never fought: the mission stops
  streaming and commanding and ends ("yielded");
* PX4 owns the landing: once AUTO_LAND is observed the mission stops streaming setpoints (PX4's
  land detector reads the trajectory_setpoint topic; a position-only stream blanks its
  commanded-descent test and the aircraft never detects touchdown);
* a landing REQUEST from outside (the interactive runtime's `land`, request_land) goes through this
  same landing: airborne it lands where it is; before arming it ends without arming; while arming it
  ends with a normal checked disarm. It never adds a controller.
